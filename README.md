#BracesML.py
The freshly baked markup language sprinkled with curly braces instead of ankle brackets. This is an official pure python
implementation based on [bracesML specification]().

## Getting Started
By default importing the library imports the braces Parser  
> import braces  
bml_root = braces.Parser('sourceFile.bml').parse()

The bml_root contains the root element in the sourceFile.bml document.
Take a look at the [bracesML specification]() file for further details on the usage
and implementation.
